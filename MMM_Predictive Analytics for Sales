## Overview
This project utilizes Python and several of its powerful libraries to predict sales based on various economic and marketing variables. Using synthetic data, we model the relationship between sales and factors such as marketing spend, product pricing, and economic indicators. This project is perfect for those looking to understand the practical applications of statistical models in business scenarios.

## Features
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Generate realistic sales data based on defined correlations.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Encode categorical variables and ensure data compatibility with modeling techniques.
- **Regression Analysis**: Fit a multivariate regression model to predict sales.
- **Visualization**: Visual comparison of actual and predicted sales values.

## Technologies Used
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `statsmodels`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`
